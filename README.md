# :computer: All About CSS :heart:
CSS3 new Features Code Demos & Ready to Use Code Snippts.

This repo is dedicated to all the new CSS features releasing in the CSS (So, it will remain WIP). This repo also has ready to use CSS + HTML based code snippets such as  - buttons, alert, etc.

This is WIP repo and less jazzy UI (I know it should be jazzy , as we are talking about CSS).

## :grey_question: Why?

While learning new CSS3 features and making youtube videos for JSLovers, I started this repo. Also, to reduce the development efforts I have created ready-to-use code samples for the devs.

## Browser Support
Working on Chrome 

## How to use this?

- Clone or download the repo.
- Ready to use code is marked with `css-demo`.
- Copy the code and use it in your project.
